It is therefore within this framework proposed by the organizers of the stakeholder days that the stakeholders can express themselves. Indeed, the rather supervisory leadership of the group of stakeholders may lead to different logics. This leadership seems to be designed to utilitarian ends: favoring expressed viewpoints that converge with the organizers’ expectations, or seeking to exclude or minimize expressed positions that would not seem to comply with them. The idea of a group of stakeholders, promoted by IPBES, is accompanied by a leadership/participation model that tends to enrol the stakeholders involved but may conversely marginalize some dissenting voices.",Antalya,IPBES,Ethnography and SNA,N,n/a,,4 days,,global governance,,
