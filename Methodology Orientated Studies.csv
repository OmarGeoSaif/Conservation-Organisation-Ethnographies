On a logistical level, my collaborating with CIFOR each summer since 1999 and engaging other aid-related forestry institutions and projects over those years provided me the necessary access and institutional intimacy to conduct this study successfully. At CIFOR I had access to project documents, participated in CIFOR meetings and was a member of various working groups within CIFOR.  With respect to being an insider, my collaborating with CIFOR and engaging other aid-related institutions over the years provided the necessary access and institutional intimacy.",,"Since
1999 and particularly during the continuous 24 month period, I conducted research with and on CIFOR and its applied research initiatives in Malinau, East Kalimantan. I was  concerned that I would be perceived by members of the international practitioner community in Indonesia as an academic who wanted to expose all that was deficient about this community, and thus in my initial interactions I highlighted my focus on village level and government dynamics and de-emphasized the institutional ethnography components of my research agenda, until we reached a certain level o f rapport. AND  ","The variability {of people beng comfortable with my research]  is in part a function of trust and familiarity: generally, the more familiar I was with members o f the practitioner community and the more trust I built with them, the more comfortable and understanding they were of my research. That said, for certain members of this community, the more familiar they became with me and my research agenda, the more threatened they felt and the less trusting they became. Equally as important, for a 24-month period I was embedded in and indeed part o f the communities I write about here, and the social and cultural intimacy derived from this intense
period ofparticipant-observation was absolutely critical to ascertaining who to talk to, what questions to ask them, and how to listen and interpret the words spoken.",," Carrying out this institutional ethnography allowed me to understand the everyday social practices and processes by which narratives are fashioned within institutions, how certain narratives becomes privileged over others, and how they are translated and brokered to recruit support for them by other actors."," I attempted to ensure not only that a broad spectrum of informants were consulted, but also that I developed rapport with them over time to both cross-check information and delve deeply into key issues",,,,"ethnographic study was also the most challenging aspect of the research for several reasons, perhaps the most pragmatic reason being that elites often do not appreciate being studied (Dove 1999b, Markowitz 2001, Pierce 1995). Indeed, ""participant observation is a research technique that does not travel well up the social structure"" (Gusterson cited in Markowitz 2001: 42). This in part explains the relative lack of ethnographies that ""study up,""14 AND the extent that I would be able to “study up” and the extent that the practitioner community would be comfortable with it were entirely unpredictable.","Further, certain CIFOR scientists - some only at certain times —viewed a critical, reflexive gaze on the institution itself as integral to the evolution and improvement of the institution itself while others did not share this sentiment, or shared it in differing degrees at different times.  AND Complicating this further, the comfort level of CIFOR’s scientists with articulating and acting on this reflexive stance also varied with individual scientist, their context, and the extent to which they were familiar and comfortable with their perception of my research agenda.","Quote from Mosse Mosse (2005:12) elaborates that although development institutions are “in the habit of dealing with criticism and the questioning of their claims and actions,” they are “less tolerant o f research that falls outside design frameworks, that does not appear to be o f practical relevance, is wasteful of time or adds complexity and makes the task of management harder.” AND from Rhee On a related point, Mosse (2005: 12) notes something that I experienced, viz., that development institutions are “less tolerant of research that falls outside design frameworks, that does not appear to be of practical relevance.” ","Further, CIFOR at an institutional level and in its various research initiatives in Malinau specifically incorporates a reflexive learning component, and hence my dissertation research in part dovetailed and harmonized with institutional objectives.

This later subsided through spending time with critical actors and speaking with friends and family. This then enabled Gould to build relations with the organisation that were nuanced.,"My first task was to make my way into the Guatemalan agrarian bureaucracy; I was welcomed in part because of my status as a white-skinned, North American of heteronormative comportment. This subject position facilitated access because of imperial histories that connect the United States and Guatemala.  After graduating from college in the mid-1990s, I was employed for 2 years as an environmental “expert” for a Washington–DC-based non-government organization operating in northern Guatemala. This job helped me develop personal and professional networks in the areas where I would conduct dissertation research almost a decade later. When I started my field work, I found old networks and friends throughout the institutions I planned to study. ","During the 20th century in particular, white men from the United States have influenced Guatemalan politics through their roles in intermingled processes of development aid, military intervention, international business, and research (Sundberg, 2003, Grandin, 2004). Furthermore, the privileges of whites in Guatemalan society date back centuries to the colonial history of Central America when light-skinned descendents of Spaniards began exercising control over nearly all aspects of governmental administration (Casaus, 1992). This history is one factor that allowed me to position myself with relative ease in the Guatemalan agrarian bureaucracy. AND A second factor that enabled me to find a place in this bureaucracy—and, as well, feel the anxiety that I did—relates to my personal history.",,,,I became convinced the policy I would study represented a threat to marginalized populations in Guatemala. I planned research on the policy hoping that the information I would produce would support the struggle for a more equitable distribution of land and resources in Guatemala.,"I did not like these early meetings, and yearned for more comfortable encounters with research subjects. To reduce my anxiety during fieldwork, I adopted a series of coping strategies. These strategies affected the interactions I had with policy-makers and my research. First, I sought to eliminate formal meetings. Instead, I tried to integrate myself into the social life of the policy process so that I could meet policy-makers under conditions that would cause me less anxiety. Since I was invited to social events by my contacts in the agrarian organizations, I accomplished this relatively easily.",,,,,,,,

I participated in conferences, workshops, and meetings that introduced me to national and international conservation actors. But it effectively meant I was working part-time on the PhD while I was  ̳in the field‘. As I explain below, AWF eventually became a field site in itself, but I was anxious that my work there compromised the time I wanted to spend in rural areas.","This situation presented me with particular ethical dilemmas related to my research.
When I started my doctoral research, I did not know that AWF and its actions would become part of this thesis, but I was regularly exposed to sensitive information regarding the accountability of AWF and the disempowerment of local people. I ended up finding out more than I wanted to—in many cases by accident—about AWF that compelled me to make profound personal, professional and ethical decisions about how to handle this information with integrity. My knowledge became a central part of my thesis, but including it could also be damaging to the AWF. Furthermore, I wanted a career in the conservation NGO sector, which would not tolerate whistle-blowers. My choice was to tell the story and resign, or to keep silent. It was a painful time. The calling and ideals that had been forged so strongly in my youth were still powerful. To make matters worse, I was then offered a promotion to Technical Director (one of the highest ranking positions in AWF) at headquarters in Washington, DC on a lucrative salary. This was the opportunity I had been striving for. In the end I decided it was a greater wrong to remain silent.
promotion offer. For two years prior I shared my concerns with the most senior leaders about AWF‘s performance and accountability in Tanzania and its impacts on local peoples, which contradicted the organization‘s mission. But I did not feel my warnings were being acted upon sufficiently. Shortly thereafter I resigned from AWF. I believed my goal of facilitating a process of self-examination and discussion by conservation NGOs would be best served by writing this thesis. I recognized, too, that this would raise questions about research without clearly specified, prior, informed consent (Berlin and Berlin 2003, Iacono 2006, Jorgensen 1971, Ramcharan 2006). Ethical issues involving NGOs and researchers elsewhere involved researchers making choices about the risks to the poor of academic exposure (Townsend and Townsend 2004). Another ethical issue is the risk to NGO funding from an academic critique (Townsend and Townsend 2004). Previous critiques of AWF had little effect on the organization or its supporters (Bonner 1993, Garland 2006, Goldman 2003, 2006, Igoe 2000, 2004, Igoe and Croucher 2007). In fact, AWF‘s budget continued to grow, which suggests that scientific publications minimally impact conservation organizations and donor thinking. Before I included more revealing aspects of AWF in my analysis, I reviewed confidentiality clauses in my employment contracts and the employee handbook. My contracts did not include such a clause and the handbook clause referred to current employees, not former employees (AWF 2004a: 10). In my accounts, I tried to be as objective as possible, but recognize that it was impossible to remain completely unbiased.","Motivation for turning to ethnography of AWF was triggered by finding out about local peoples resentment to conservation AND In that respect, the parallel body of research on development NGOs may offer social scientists models of how they can constructively engage with the conservation NGO sector.",,"Another ethical issue is the risk to NGO funding from an academic critique (Townsend and Townsend 2004). Previous critiques of AWF had little effect on the organization or its supporters  AND This is not to say, however, that the majority of AWF‘s staff lacked capacity or were not dedicated to conservation and helping people. Most staff probably did believe they were doing the right things, but similar to me before I spent time with local people, simply lacked accurate information about AWF‘s impact at a ground level—a consequence of the urban-based structure and low accountability demanded by donors. We dutifully produced, and were some of the most avid consumers of AWF‘s beautiful marketing materials from urban bases far removed from local people and the realities of the field. AND Moreover, so much time spent in a truck, on patrol, or sitting in the bush, enabled me to buildrapport with APU personnel.It was only after building rapport during these outings that I conducted more formal interviews with the field rangers and managers.

SANParks is a large, complex conservation bureaucracy. I felt that a case study would provide an opportunity to glimpse something of the universal through the particular (Coyle 2007), understanding transformation through SANParks experience.","I visited SANParks corporate office to collect documents and make observations related to the study, and during these visits I took the opportunity to engage in informal discussions with SANParks staff as a way of gaining insight and clarifying matters of interest in this study. This served to build trust and rapport with identified SANParks members, and stimulate their interest and support for my research. AND I used official documents to gain an understanding of the issues relating to transformation so that my interview schedule would be tailored and adjusted to address the issues emerging in the documents.  AND  I realized that having targeted questions on race and racism in protected area management would be inappropriate and potentially cause tension in the interview process taking into account their emotional aspects linked to the legacy of apartheid and the contested nature of transformation in post-apartheid South Africa. So I probed with sensitivity the issues of black empowerment, affirmative action and hiring of black professionals and the responses of whites to transformation efforts. I allowed the conversation to flow from answers to questions to more of a narrative (Courrau 2002), and I paid attention to what appeared to fascinate the interviewees by probing further their comments, terms and metaphors. The interview protocol was designed to obtain evidence of and information on the critical incidents associated with the transformation process at SANParks. It also ensured comparability across interviews as well as helped focus the interviews on themes relevant to the study.",Trust was important,,,"It is hard to deal with issues that are contested, controversial and with wider socio-political implications for management and day-to-day activities within the organization. ",SANParks’ senior executives provided unwavering support for this study because they believe that independent research would shed some new light on the transformation process in the organization. Such support reflected to me an organization that is willing to learn itself through scrutiny and independent research. ,,"However, I found that being a black student researching issues of transformation presented a challenge to both black and white interviewees, and I had to avoid personal opinions on the issue. Whenever I was asked a question that required my opinion, whether intellectual or personal, I had to be diplomatic in expressing my reluctance to share it since I felt it would unduly influence the interview.

Donor timelines and different objectives across scales can be incompatible with early local input. However, early local input is critical to get full buy-in and support. There is a need to connect early with strong connected in-country networks, partnerships, and coalitions. Creating or linking with NPCs takes time and should be planned for in program schedules.Participation matters a great deal. Engaged participation in ENGO programs is engendered through local PIs, governance mechanisms, early workshops, node coordinators, and capacity building programs. Participation can affect change in program headquarters as well as at program sites. Downwards as well as upwards accountability is important for ENGO programs. Downwards accountability can be enhanced through node coordinators, organizational offices, governance mechanisms, progress reports, and participatory workshops. Accountability matters little without an organizational ability to learn and adapt. Translation of scientific knowledge does not just go on at the end of a program cycle, but rather is continuous throughout. Involvement in processes rather than production of products is crucial to effective information translation. Country-specific contextual factors affect the ability of ENGO program to have an impact","My access to MMAS was gained through social networks, with my advisor using professional connections to pitch the idea to Dr. Karrer, the Senior Director of the MMAS program. My advisor had been working with CI for some time and thus was well placed to help me gain entry. Additionally, at that point Dr. Karrer was on my committee and thus had greater than average knowledge about my skills, expertise, and research objectives. Once her consent was granted, she worked to help me gain access to key project informants at all sites. Thus, Dr. Karrer was very much fitting the role of a gatekeeper AND  Not forgetting the ‘pragmatic action research’ part of MSPAR, negotiating benefit makes up part of the access process. Specifics of the research proposal should be discussed in order to orient the project towards organizational learning and improvement (Whyte 1989). ",,,,"Informants commit their time and effort to a research project that they may not see any benefit from; they often commit their friendship to a researcher who spends just a few months or weeks in any one particular site. It has been argued that scientific results enhance general academic knowledge, improving the world somewhere down the line (Walker 2007). When conducting a multi-sited ethnography on an organization, this argument can be unconvincing to gatekeepers (Morrill et al. 1999), especially when research threatens to expose  issues with the organization’s work and the research will take away from the organizations most valuable asset, time (V. Smith 2001) "," This hybrid I termed ‘multi-sited pragmatic action research’ (MSPAR). MSPAR is multi-sited, focused on projects, amenable to limited time frames, and enables creating reciprocal benefit for both the researcher and the organization/social group being studied. MSPAR recognizes that social scientists must work closer with ENGOs to enable both biological and cultural biodiversity preservation (Orlove and Brush 1996; Peterson et al. 2008) and improve the practice of running ENGO conservation and science program"," My unedited project proposal was presented and analyzed, with CI employees discussing various elements of it and thinking about how I could create products that would be useful for the organization.

Copies of the report were sent to node coordinators and several consultants working with CI, enabling dissemination and learning throughout the project structure While there was not complete agreement on my conclusions (as was to be expected with any report that has an element of critique), it stimulated a constructive debate on how MMAS has been implemented and how it could best move forward, enabling positive tweaks to program management",,,,,

views of the landscape.",,,,,My goal is to advance an understanding of conservation as a criss-crossed network of practices rather than as a procedure or process that moves linearly from start to finish. I am also interested in the qualities of conservation practice that are ubiquitous across different projects and not isolated to any one style of initiative or type of activity.  AND The goal of the dissertation is precisely to complicate the ease with which we label and categorize socio-environmental practices.,,"Ethnographers frequently describe how formal methods can become deeply intertwined with the rhythms of living in a community as close relationships are formed with research subjects and places. What is often emphasized is the way these close-knit research encounters trouble distinctions between insider and outsider, researcher and subject, home and field. In my experience, however, there is more going on in this confusion than just a renegotiation of cultural closeness and difference. As researchers become immersed in the routines and schedules of their collaborators—playing bingo with local villagers, participating in a harvest, engaging in the everyday spaces of meals and family life—they enter into perplexing spaces of practical and bodily confusion. In inhabiting new regimes of practice, ingrained ways of moving and gesturing, gastronomic likes and dislikes, physical abilities and limitations, skills and know-how get reworked at a material and bodily level—the researcher comes to smell, see, hear, and feel differently.
For me, it was often in these spaces of bodily confusion where I developed the sensibilities necessary to do my research. For example, in traveling back and forth from my home in Valdivia to my research site at the Valdivian Coastal Reserve, I took dozens of trips on the ferry boat that connected and southern and northern shores of the Valdivia River. On these journeys, I started to absorb at a bodily level what it means to live on the coast with limited access to transportation. I saw families laboring as they loaded supplies onto the boat, watched as small children were bundled up against the cold winds of the bay, and felt in my own body the precarious rocking of the boat in rough weather or the sense of peace out on the water at sunset. In feeling my way through these lived encounters, I came to understand my research site at a corporeal level and became attuned to the physical and emotional experiences of research “subjects.” Yet in the midst of activity I would have been hard pressed to articulate how such encounters informed my fieldwork. They were just part of being in a place, getting around, and engaging with people.",,,"Over the course of my fieldwork, I became increasingly convinced that to adequately describe practice in contexts where verbal communication is often secondary, we need more creative and risky ways of doing ethnography.

Recognizing positioning by others is fairly straight-forward: the anthropologist who has “studied down” may be identified and known to be part of particular networks and have particular sympathies. Without discounting the importance of these relations, I would highlight the way reference group theory points to the more subjective side of positioning: the anthropologist can also be expected (I certainly did) to reflect on how one’s past informants might evaluate one’s actions and positions. The behavior and reasoning of social actors—not least the anthropologist—is shaped not only by external evaluation, but by self-evaluation in terms of imagined (and occasionally present) audiences of peers of different kinds, with the recognition that the group with whom one interacts most regularly on a day-to-day basis may not be the group to whom one is primarily oriented (Merton 1968, cf. Hefner 1990, 238-242). I would suggest that this allows for a more nuanced and contextually sensitive reading of position than “socially defined identity categories” (Agrawal 2005, 174) of race, gender, ethnicity, etc., which in practice do not necessarily correspond to clear-cut stances in conservation debate",,"The second encounter I describe took place three days later. I arranged a meeting at the Parks Board headquarters with Mr Ntombela,5 the Community Relations Manager of the Parks Board. Coming so soon after the previous meeting, this encounter made it clear that my history could have very different effects: rather than being viewed (apparently) as part of the networks that were aligned with communities against the reserve management, in this context I was engaged as an expert on the communities with which the Parks Board was trying to build relationships.",,,,,,,"Studying up after studying down: rather, my history of prior engagement and commitments shaped the ethnographic encounters.AND  the anthropologist can also be expected (I certainly did) to reflect on how one’s past informants might evaluate one’s actions and positions. The behaviour and reasoning of social actors – not least the anthropologist – is shaped not only by external evaluation, but by self-evaluation in terms of imagined (and occasionally present) audiences of peers of different kinds, with the recognition that the group with whom one interacts most regularly on a day-to-day basis may not be the group to whom one is primarily oriented (Merton 1968; cf. Hefner 1990, 238–242). ","Socially minded conservationists can find resbite in discussions with critical social scientists as they are a reference group which appreciate their efforts in going against the grain in traditional hardline biodiversity protection settings: At the time, he was the only person in the Eastern Cape Parks Board assigned full-time to ‘people and parks’ and community relations issues, with a portfolio of more than a dozen protected areas. This position meant that in practice, he could find himself advocating for communities and development within the organization against those with less interest in people and more interest in biodiversity conservation. In the language of reference group theory, for the Community Relations manager, I and other researchers provided an alternative reference group to his more hard-line conservation colleagues. AND My history of work around Dwesa-Cwebe also made me a source of information on community relations that were not captured in the institutional history and memory of his organization. In the years following our initial meeting, until his departure from the organization in 2013, we had a series of email exchanges and meetings in which we discussed the history of negotiations that took place between 1998 and 2003, before he was on the scene, proposals for co-management, local politics, etc. In these conversations, Mr Ntombela expressed his frustration that he did not know all of this history. At the same time, this relationship posed a relatively easy situation for me with reference to my earlier fieldwork; I could advocate for the interests and policies expressed by Dwesa-Cwebe leadership, with an interlocutor who was both personally sympathetic and in a position that allowed him to engage with my knowledge and recommendations.","NOT talking about issues outside current responsibility, Some aspects of this encounter reflect familiar issues from the literatures on studying up. Professionals are busy, concerned with protecting both their reputations and their institutions, for example, by not commenting on matters outside of current areas of responsibility. This situation was compounded by a personal history and positioning: he knew from our many encounters over my earlier fieldwork that I had close ties and sympathies with local leaders who were antagonistic to the policies he had maintained, and that I had a history of arguing for consideration of local utilization of forest resources. At least in relation to Dwesa-Cwebe, this history would preclude my ability to engage him as an informant, though he did hold out the possibility of some conversations about presumably less controversial settings elsewhere.","Not to linger on history is one thing: Given this history, I was somewhat surprised but pleased when he was quite enthusiastic about meeting when we spoke on the phone. We met a few days later in the conference room adjoining his office by the entrance to the reserve; Mr Maduna was sharply dressed in his field uniform, and the table was laid out with maps of the reserve and charts of the schedules of reserve staff, together presenting the trappings of authority and a material setting that conveyed his busyness. In our meeting, he was, as I put it to a colleague afterwards, ‘extremely friendly and cordial, and completely unhelpful’, telling me (it seemed quite genuinely) how surprised he was to see me again, but also politely refusing to engage in a conversation about Dwesa-Cwebe. He deflected all of my questions, explaining that ‘I don’t want to confuse, I don’t want to lie’, emphasizing that he had been away from Dwesa-Cwebe for three years, and referring me to the current reserve manager.  AND  Mr Ntombela also expressed a certain envy of the ways that academic researchers working in the areas under his purview were privileged in terms of having the time and the resources to do the research that he would have liked to do.",

There are more stereotypically neoliberal, market-fundamentalist politics that are now enrolling ecosystem services in hegemonic, colonial-capitalist projects that must be resisted.

I was also invited to perform a variety of tasks including literature reviews, assisting in the preparation of working documents, and supporting official deliberations for the Secretariat. I was also reading voluminous, seemingly endless documents generated by the Platform during most of this period.

I remain unsure whether on this score I have delivered more than she bargained for or not enough. AND I will conclude by noting that in my final interview with Pacheco, he asked explicitly for help. He asked for more political ecologists and other critical scholars to join the Platform—to invite them to populate its expert groups and to help steer IPBES away from the framework’s more dire expressions and toward what he believed were its still worthwhile possibilities.

Korsant concludes that as conservation increasingly works with communities there will need to be more anthropologists to study these encounters so that power battles, tenions  and hirearchies across and between multiple stakeholders can be illumunated.","My previous relationship with the Natural defense resource council 
US-based environmental advocacy NGO, proved to be a useful introduction (having once labeled the Osa a “bio-gem”), and helped foster a relationship with Osa Conservation (OC), a Costa Rican managed environmental NGO with roots in the international AND Peace Corps was another useful gatekeeper, largely due to the enthusiasm of the volunteer that I met working in Rancho Quemado. Some other institutional assistance was provided by Stanford University’s INOGO8 effort, and relationships with that team aided in an understanding of environmental conflicts in the area and fostered connections with other researchers and residents. The head of the forest reserve provided helpful access to the government’s environmental management branch (MINAE10), conservation system (SINAC11), and even critical campesinos who he thought would broaden my perspective on environmental conflicts.",,,,"Although I struggled with the ethics of Jacques’ request for real names and a polemic document that could be used for purposes that align with his political agenda of demanding justice, the demands of research were such that maintaining distance from activism proved important. Using pseudonyms protects research participant identities in many cases and helps distinguish research from other types of ethnographic writing.","The research presented here is concerned with the interrelations between environmentalism, a sense of Costa Rican belonging, and global capital.",,,,,,,,,

This is deemed important because there is too little funding, time, space and so sacfricies must me made. It helps explain why decisions are made in organutan conservation. In the end sadness and ""staying with trouble"" is argued to be what orangutan conservation is about.

Though the research for this book didn’t involve any methods from primate field studies (though I do draw on the primatological literature), I think it’s fair to describe myself as ethically part-primatologist (see Palmer, in press). For this reason, this book is not only about, but also for conservationists, among other audiences – I hope it will also appeal to social scientists, philo- sophers, and members of the public interested in conservation and orangutans.",,"Discussions around whitleblowing on conservation organisations and how to manage this in writing, Obviously, all this talk about keeping secrets and whistle-blowing applies as much to me, an ethnographer, as it does to community insiders. To help figure out my own personal and professional obligations in this situation, I asked several friends and mentors when, and why, they thought it would be appropriate for me to reveal the orangutan conservation community’s dark side. One cynical response I received multiple times was, “How much do you want to stay involved in orangutan conservation?” In other words, the choice to keep or reveal secrets is inextricably linked to the broader question in ethnography of how to balance insider–outsider status, with the choice to reveal secrets a step towards reinforcing outsider status.
This question about secret-keeping in turn relates to broader questions around ethnographic ethics and audiences. While ethnographic ethics typic- ally focus on protecting participants from harm – potentially a contrast with journalistic ethics, which focus more on revealing truths that sources might be concealing (Peterson, 2010)",,,,,,,,,,

implications on caste, gender, and labour processes in the landscape","Conducting research in India as an Indian national did not require me to follow any strict visa
protocol or to apply for any research permits. This process is significantly different for non-Indian
nationals, especially from overseas academic institutions. The advantages arising through these
circumstances saved me a lot of time which I could redirect towards fieldwork. However, when it
comes to doing research on conservation that entails interviewing Forest Department staff and
entering the boundaries of a protected area, permissions are required thorough relevant authorities
within the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MOEFCC). At first and during was mainly due to the requirement of a long often ardent process of permits that are issued by the
Chief Wildlife Warden of the state of Uttarakhand. However, while interviewing the Chief Wildlife
Warden, I was encouraged to expand my respondent groups or interview sample to include
frontline staff of the CTR. After receiving my formal permission application, the officer expedited
the process and granted me a research permit that gave me legal access to spend time interviewing
and observing frontline forest staff within the boundaries of the CTR and residents who lived or
collected forest resources within the CTR. This did challenge my presumptions of the forest
bureaucracy, which is largely seen as a rigid and guarded structure when it comes to critical research
on conservation. Although, this may be more of an anomaly rather than a norm and not least
guided by the fact that the officer held a PhD with interests in political ecology. Nonetheless, this
aspect of acquiring permissions was decisive and played a central role in generating the rich
ethnographic material that has been analysed and presented in this thesis.
the initial stages of my fieldwork I did not have plans to conduct interviews and participant
observations with frontline forest staff or with residents inside the boundaries of the CTR. This","While conducting participant observation with women, I was particularly conscious of tensions
relating to my positionality and privilege as a cis man, studying the lived experiences of women in
a gendered space such as the forests of the CTR. In this light, I hold my own work open to critical
questions that must be asked of any man doing research adopting a feminist outlook. I accept that
conducting a credible and thorough ethnographic inquiry in such gendered spaces is difficult to
achieve. Therefore, any contributions made to topics that highlight issues of gender in a male
dominated society must undergo a process of continuous reflexivity to undermine the signs of
gender privilege from field to text (Levinson 1998). As a cis man I am not in a position to argue
or judge whether the contributions of male ethnographers in a women’s world such as the forest
spaces of Corbett are necessary or not.  AND Participant observations with women forest produce collectors were arranged with the help of my
local advisors and through snowballing from interview contacts. I followed women forest produce
collectors as they went about their daily activities collecting forest resources. I particularly made
observations on the nature of conversations between women and the changing behaviours, body
language and dialog when women came across CSTs. Interviews that I had conducted with many
individual women had acted as icebreakers and made it easier to gain access and build trust.
Although women were conscious of my presence during the initial stages, they later opened up
and became comfortable with my presence. I attribute this to the constant presence of my female
field consultant, the trust building stage of my fieldwork and the active interviews I conducted in
parallel with the participant observations with the women.",,,"As mentioned before, I took verbal consent from my
respondents after informing them about the details of the project and the strategies in place to
protect their anonymity. However, on many occasions my respondents were themselves keen on
their names being used for quotes or in descriptions of events in my narratives. This was
particularly and surprisingly common with members of vulnerable communities who were keen to
have their voice recorded while I interviewed them. In fact, some researchers claim that through
anonymity voices of research participants are lost and are not amplified enough and in effect
appropriated by researchers (Weinberg 2002, Van Den Hoonard 2003). As I conducted fieldwork
in hierarchical setting with deeply entrenched social inequalities, I found ethical demands of
maintaining confidentiality conflicting. I was in an ethical dilemma about causing no harm to my
respondents while at the same time respecting their agency and crediting respondents especially
from vulnerable groups who wanted their voices to be amplified. In cases where respondents particularly
requested to be quoted, I took a decision on a case-to-case basis by carefully reviewing the impacts
of doing so, as their comments or actions could potentially be harmful for others from similar
backgrounds.",,"To elicit unbiased responses from frontline forest staff, I
would go to different forest chowkis and anti-poaching camps directly instead of setting up
appointments through the central office. This circumvents the scope of gatekeeping by senior
forest officials, who would only suggest interviews with conforming forest staff, while withholding
access to more critical and non-conforming staff members. ",,,,,,,,
